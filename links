No worries! You can still learn and practice machine learning without a GPU. While having a GPU can speed up training, many machine learning tasks can be accomplished effectively using CPUs, especially for smaller datasets or simpler models. Here's an updated 3-month roadmap that doesn't require a GPU:

ðŸ“… Month 1: Machine Learning Foundations (Focus on theory and practical coding)
Week 1: Learn Python libraries for ML (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).

Focus on data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.
Week 2: Master Supervised Learning algorithms.

Study linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and k-NN.
Implement basic models using Scikit-learn.
Week 3: Learn Unsupervised Learning techniques.

Explore clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
Work on basic projects like customer segmentation.
Week 4: Get hands-on with model evaluation and improvement.

Learn metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Understand model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
ðŸŽ¯ Projects:

Build a linear regression model to predict house prices.
Create a clustering model for market segmentation.
ðŸ“… Month 2: Deepening Knowledge (More models, advanced techniques, and introduction to deep learning)
Week 5: Study Ensemble Methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).

Learn to combine weak learners to make more robust predictions.
Week 6: Learn Neural Networks.

Study the basics of deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow (using CPU).
Start with simple neural networks for classification tasks.
Week 7: Work with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Understand their application in image recognition tasks.
Train small CNN models on small datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10.
Week 8: Explore Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Learn about tokenization, stemming, and using TF-IDF.
Work on text classification or sentiment analysis.
ðŸŽ¯ Projects:

Build a model for image classification using CNN (e.g., MNIST dataset).
Implement a simple NLP model for sentiment analysis.
ðŸ“… Month 3: Model Deployment and Portfolio Building
Week 9: Learn Model Deployment Basics.

Deploy models using Flask or FastAPI for APIs.
Learn how to containerize apps with Docker.
Week 10: Focus on ML Pipeline and Production-Ready Models.

Understand how to handle data preprocessing, model training, and serving in production.
Work on data preprocessing pipelines for real-time prediction.
Week 11: Learn about Cloud Deployment.

Deploy models on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud) without requiring a GPU.
Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
Week 12: Polish your Portfolio.

Work on a final project to demonstrate the models you've built, such as a recommendation system, customer churn prediction, or an NLP chatbot.
ðŸŽ¯ Projects:

Deploy a model on a cloud platform.
Set up a machine learning pipeline from data collection to deployment.
ðŸ”¥ Summary:
Month 1: Learn machine learning basics, algorithms, and evaluation.
Month 2: Dive deeper into advanced models and deep learning basics.
Month 3: Learn model deployment and refine your portfolio.
By following this plan, you should be able to build solid skills in machine learning without needing a GPU and still be able to deploy models effectively!
